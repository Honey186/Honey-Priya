Air pollution is a growing concern, especially in urban areas, impacting health and the environment. This project aims to use machine learning to classify air quality levels based on pollutant data (e.g., PM2.5, NOâ‚‚, CO). The goal is to automate air quality monitoring, identify key pollutants, and support timely environmental interventions.
